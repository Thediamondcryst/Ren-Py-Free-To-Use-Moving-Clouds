# Ren-Py-Free-to-Use-Moving-Clouds

Woo! New Open sourced system!

This time, it's clouds. Clouds are a way to add animations to backgrounds. It's small, but a nice detail to add to backgrounds.

This project includes 7 clouds in 3 different versions: Day, Sunset/Sunrise and Night. All clouds are free to use, free to edit, and free to add new ones.
Any new clouds should follow the flat and intentional art style, meant to work with any or most backgrounds. 


# Contributing
Day clouds versions features a white base (#FFFFFF), with a light blue midground (#eaf6fc), and a blue-ish foreground (#b4d7f7).

Sunset clouds versions features a blue grey-ish base (#646478), with a darker blue grey-ish midground (#5b5f75), and a dark blue grey-ish foreground (#495371).*
Or, add a black (#000000) Color Overlay effect with the Darken blending mode to the Day clouds and set it set to 60% opacity, and another Color Overlay to it set as Dark Blue (#101055) with the Color blending mode set to 30% opacity.*
This should works with darker sunset images, especially near the sky above the sun, where it's slowly getting to night time.

Night clouds versions features a dark blue grey-ish base (#27263a), with a darker dark blue grey-ish midground (#25263a), and a darker darker dark blue grey-ish foreground (#20233a).*
Or, add a really dark blue (#100f25) Color Overlay effect with the Darken blending mode to the Day clouds and set it to 90% opacity.*

*Note: These colors were made to work with Daring Academy, so it may not work with all games. But, since this is open source, feel free to edit them and add the to the project.
	   Just, don't edit those in "images/clouds/daring_academy_clouds/", since it would break compatibility with the game when upgrading. Thanks!



If you use this system, feel free to credit "Thediamondcrystal" in your game's credits. (But, it's not required. I just wanted to make moving clouds in Daring Academy, and decided to gift this to anyone!)



Anyways, thank you to anyone who uses this system, and enjoy moving clouds!
